    <p>
        The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is designed to streamline the
        submission, verification, and approval of monthly claims for Independent
        Contractor lecturers. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle user data,
        even at the prototype stage, to demonstrate best practices in secure software
        development. For more details about the system’s purpose and scope, visit the
        <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="About">About Page</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">1. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>At this prototype stage, all data entered into the system is fictional and used solely for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, the system would collect the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lecturer details (name, ID, contact information)</li>
        <li>Claim information (hours worked, hourly rate, claim month)</li>
        <li>Supporting documents uploaded for claims</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-4">2. Data Usage</h3>
    <p>Data collected is intended solely for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Submitting and tracking monthly claims</li>
        <li>Verification and approval by Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers</li>
        <li>Maintaining transparency and accountability in the claims process</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-4">3. Data Security</h3>
    <p>In a fully implemented system, all sensitive information would be stored securely and access restricted to authorized personnel only. During this prototype stage, no real personal information is stored.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">4. Data Retention</h3>
    <p>
        In a production environment, claim records and associated documents would be
        retained only for the duration required by institutional policy and legal
        compliance. In this prototype, no actual data is stored beyond the
        demonstration session.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">5. User Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>Users should ensure that any real data used in a production environment is accurate and compliant with institutional privacy standards. Prototype data is for demonstration purposes only.</p>
